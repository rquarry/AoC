## 1-2
Took this opportunity to use a Go map for string and int values of numbers. My approach was intended to be more educational with Go than efficient with my proces of int -> Itoa -> combined string -> int. 

Took way to long to discover my issue with strings that contained multiples of the same number word (line 87-89)
