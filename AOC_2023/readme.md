# Notes

## 2-1
There were major plans for this solution that involved structs, one of which was [embedded](https://gobyexample.com/struct-embedding). In the end, this 80 lines of code that just uses strings.Split() over and over gets the job done pretty well. 

To-do: Look at solution to "read" string for integer values instead of using hard codes array indexes.
